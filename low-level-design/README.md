Working at Shopify has made me realize my lack of OOP and LLD. This repo contains notes and solutions to LLD problems. I'll primarily be following https://github.com/ashishps1/awesome-low-level-design/tree/main. I also have an interview for xAI next week and they don't do leetcode so I need to get better...

## Introduction 

**High Level Design**: Wha† components do we need to be build solve this problem? (classic system design)
**Low Level Design**: How do we implement the components in order to create working code? 

*Core Components*: 
- Classes and Objects 
- Interfaces and Abstractions
- Relationships between Classes
- Method Signatures
- Design Patterns

*Benefits of Good LLD*: 
- Maintainability
- Scalability and Performance
- Testability 
- Collaboration 
- Reusability

*Order of Operations*: 
1. Identify requirements 
2. Define interfaces for requirements
3. Create concrete classes for requirements 
4. Tie classes together using abstracted classes to wrap them
